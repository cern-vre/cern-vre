# Create StorageClass for provisioning CVMFS automount volumes,
# and a PersistentVolumeClaim that's fulfilled by the StorageClass.

# If Controller plugin is not deployed, follow the example in volume-pv-pvc.yaml.

# Notes for the VRE cluster.
# StorageClass is not needed because is already deployed when starting the cluster.
# Othersiwe, have a look to the documentation on the link above
